        <h2> Analog Clock </h2>
        
        <h5 style="font-size:15px">
         For this project, we were tasked with creating an abstract clock. Based on last year's digital clock, I knew that I wanted to make an analog clock. Moreover, I wanted to make an intricate clock that had many new properties. This clock tells the time, the day, the month, and the year on separate parts. Moreover, the clock determines if it is currently morning, afternoon, evening, or night. Lastly, when you input a location, it gives you the temperature of the place. To enter a location, simply input the place you want (New York City, Dubai, etc.). There is no need to input state or country.
         <br><br>
         The hardest part of this project was grabbing the specified location's weather data. This was done using a JSON file that would gather the String's data. It would then return the data to the dial and displayed as such.
         <br><br>
         If I were to refactor this project, I would want to data to also return value for the location's time.
         <br><br>
         I hope you find good use of this clock!
