         This was a project that we made to simulate rolling dice. It is set on a timer so that the user does not have to do any work. However, you can still click the screen if you want to roll. The aim of the game is to roll a 73.
         <br><br>
         The hardest part was calculating the totals. Finding how many of each die there was and then finding the sum presented some difficulties. This was calculated by grabbing the values of the random variable determining the number of each die.
         <br><br>
         If I were to refactor it, I would make it so that the goal number is a random value rather than a preset number.
         <br><br>
         I wish you luck in rolling the 73!
