         This was a project for which we were given the task of creating a simple game. The most important part was to add "juice" - sounds, colors, moving pieces, and more. This project was a lot of fun. The controls are simple: click on the screen right away in order to render the user. To move, use the right and left arrow keys. To shoot, press the space bar. Every second you waste is 10 points you lose. It has also been scaled.

         The hardest part of this project was creating the alien ships and their corresponding functions. They had to exist, move, and blow up/disappear.
         <br><br>
         If I were to refactor this project, I would make it so that the aliens can shoot back at the user.
         <br><br>
         Go stop to the aliens!
