         This was our capstone project for class last year. It tested all the skills we learned. I chose to create a clock. It was many functions. Obviously, it can tell the time and date. It also determines whether it is day or night. As such, the icon in the top right changes, as does the entire color scheme of the clock. It also has an alarm function. Finally, you can input weather via the icon on the bottom right.
         <br><br>
         The hardest part of this project was designing the alarm function. Initially, when the alarm rang, it made an extremelyugly noise because it was constantly looping. This was avoided using a boolean that would set to false right after it rang, forcing the alarm to end after one loop.
         <br><br>
         If I were to refactor this project, I would add more icons for weather and time of day.
         <br><br>
         I hope this clock helps you to stay time efficient!
