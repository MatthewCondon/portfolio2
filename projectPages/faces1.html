        <h5 style="font-size:15px">
         This was one of the first mini-projects we worked on last year. The goal of it was to make the same faces appear all over the screen via a for-loop. The faces were designed and then made location-dependent upon given variables from the double loop.
         <br><br>
         This mini-project posed no huge challenges. Using p5js to make images was difficult at first, but most likely because it was a new system.
         <br><br>
         If I were to refactor it, I would like to change the design of the faces to make them more complicated. I would also have different faces based on a random value for picking.
         <br><br>
         I hope you enjoy the mini-project.
