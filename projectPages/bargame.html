        <h5 style="font-size:15px">
         This is a game I designed at the end of class last year. The rules are very simple: press the mouse as fast as you can. More importantly, go until the computer notes that you have won.
         <br><br>
         The hardest part about this project was making it so that the computer was racing you. I needed to make it so that the computer was "clicking" at a consistent rate. I did so by simply making the computer's x-value increment by 10 when frameCount % 10 == 0.
         <br><br>
         If I were to refactor this project, I would likely make the computer movements smoother so that a "click" is not so abrupt. I essentially want it to glide across the screen.
         <br><br>
         Now, time to start clicking!
