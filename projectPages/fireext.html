         The goal of this project was to become comfortable with random walks and arrays. The rules are very simple: hold down the mouse to activate the fire extinguisher. While it is on, bring it closer to fire to put it out.
         <br><br>
         The hardest part of this project was the fading aspect of putting out the fire. I did not want it to simply disappear as a whole. So, I worked out the mechanics to make it slowly disappear by using transparency values of rectangles.
         <br><br>
         If I were to refactor this project, I would want the flames and smoke to disappear in a smoother manner. I also would like to have the ash smoking.
         <br><br>
         Quick, put out the fire!
