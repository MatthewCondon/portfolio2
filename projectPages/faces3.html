        <h2> Faces 3 </h2>
        
        <h5 style="font-size:15px">
         The goal of this project was to test the skills we practiced in <i> Faces 1 </i> and <i> Faces 2 </i>. Essentially, there is a double for-loop that determines the location of the faces. Moreover, when the mouse is clicked, the design of the faces change. Finally, the eyes change colors and the pupils move around.
         <br><br>
         The hardest part of this project was making the shapes of the mouths change with the faces. Essentially, changing the mouth shape was not dependent upon user input. This was done with a series of random variables.
         <br><br>
         If I were to refactor this project, I would want to make more faces of different sizes.
         <br><br>
         I hope you find this project enjoyable!
