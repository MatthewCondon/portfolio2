         This project's purpose was to create a holiday card that incorporated the skills we have learned so far. It has moving objects, snowflakes and arrays, and a countdown. The use of the vertex function was also incorporated when making the stars in the sky.
         <br><br>
         The hardest part of this project was the countdown feature. I overcame this challenge by grabbing the time 2022 will begin and the current time. Then, I did some math with the numbers to determine the countdown values.
         <br><br>
         If I were to refactor this project, I would want to add sound. I did try to add background music, but it kept crashing the program.
         <br><br>
         Hopefully you feel more festive!
