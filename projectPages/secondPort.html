         This is the new portfolio that I decided to work on during Winter Break (and the version that you are using right now). I wanted to design a portfolio that looked more professional and was more organized.
         <br><br>
         The hardest part of making this portfolio was making it more comptabile for mobile devices. As such, I had to shrink everything to a point where it worked on desktop and mobile devices.
         <br><br>
         To get a better feel for this portfolio, please take a look around.
         <br><br>
         I hope this portfolio helps you better understand my journey in Computer Science!
