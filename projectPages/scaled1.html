        <h5 style="font-size:15px">
         This was one the projects I made while working the scaling concept. For this, I made a disco ball that was scaled by the canvas size. Inputting any value will make it scale evenly. It was relatively simple to do, as it required only even proportions to make it work properly.
         <br><br>
         The hardest part was finding the scaled locations for the lines across the disco ball. This was found by using hard code at first and then determining proportions.
         <br><br>
         If I were to refactor it, I would likely used curves instead of lines on the disco ball.
         <br><br>
         I hope this puts you in the party mood!
