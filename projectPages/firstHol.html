        <h2> First Holidays Card </h2>
        
        <h5 style="font-size:15px">
         This project was our first using p5js. We were tasked with creating a scene for a holiday card. As such, I made a Christmas tree with presents, a fireplace, and a window with snow. I sent this card to my brother as a gift.
         <br><br>
         The hardest part of this project was making the snow in the window, primarily because it was such a new concept. This was completed using an array of ellipses.
         <br><br>
         If I were to refactor this project, I would want make the ornaments on the tree change color.
         <br><br>
         I hope this card livens your holiday spirit!
